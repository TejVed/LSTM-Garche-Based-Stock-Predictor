# Implementation of LSTM-Garche based Stock Prediction Algorithm
The model uses both single-layer and multi-layer perceptrons using the Hebb's algorithm.  A sample dataset of 30 items is used for testing of binary classification. The accuracy is high, and the weights required will appear on executing the given code.  A separate .py file spelled wrongly is added, which comprises of my own extra work comprising making a 3-layer neural network which acts as a classifier using Logistic Regression; and implements Gradient Descent for optimization.   Time Dependant Neural Networks and Multilayer Perceptron Network have also been completed.  Using statistic, I've also done the testing and implementation of various standard models, including Stock Forecasting, Time Series, Garch, arch and the arima model.  I have also made a separate model to run a hybrid Garch-LSTM model.
